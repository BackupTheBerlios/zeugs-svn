To generate an installation package for windows.

*) All the necessary support libraries, python, etc. must be installed.
  Also PyInstaller must be unpacked and NSIS (windows installer
  generator) must be installed.

*) Unpack the zeugs archive (not the source archive).

*) Edit zeugs_PyI.bat to change the paths to PyInstaller and python
  if necessary.

*) The windows installer for the current version of PyQt4 (4.3.1) is
  built using the Microsoft compiler and requires the C++ library
  msvcp71.dll, but it does not include it. If you don't have this
  already you can get it from the internet. I don't know where the
  best place to put it is, but I placed it in my python folder
  (c:\python25) and PyInstaller could pick it up there.

*) Make sure the dictionaries are available in a folder. You need
  the files for your language ending .dic and .aff (from OpenOffice).

*) Edit zeugs.spec to change any paths that might need adjusting, for example
  to the dictionary folder.

*) Run zeugs_PyI.bat, by (double?-)clicking on it.

*) Run zeugs-nsi.py, by (double?-)clicking on it (if python is set up to
  execute.py programs automatically), to generate the NSIS configuration.

*) Run NSIS. This can be done by right-clicking on zeugs.nsi and selecting
 'Compile NSIS Script'.

*) A Zeugs-Setup-<version>.exe file should appear.
