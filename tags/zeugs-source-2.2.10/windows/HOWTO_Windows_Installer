To generate an installation package for windows.

0) All the necessary support libraries, python, etc. must be installed.
  Also PyInstaller and NSIS (windows installer generator) must be installed.

1) Unpack the zeugs archive (not the source archive).

2) Edit zeugs_PyI.bat to change the paths to PyInstaller and python
  if necessary.

3) Make sure the dictionaries are available in a folder.

4) Edit zeugs.spec to change any paths that might need adjusting, for example
  to the dictionary folder.

5) Run zeugs_PyI.bat, by (double?-)clicking on it.

6) Run zeugs-nsi.py, by (double?-)clicking on it (if python is set up to
  execute.py programs automatically), to generate the NSIS configuration.

7) Run NSIS. This can be done by right-clicking on zeugs.nsi and selecting
 'Compile NSIS Script'.

8) A Zeugs-Setup-<version> file should appear.
