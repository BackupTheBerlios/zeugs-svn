build.sh is a script to build a Zeugs distribution package for Linux
using PyInstaller.

PyInstaller itself doesn't need to be installed, just unpack it somewhere
convenient. Don't use version 1.3. If no later version is available, get it
from SVN.

Edit the script so that the paths 'pyinstallerPath' and 'dicPath' are set
correctly (your dictionaries must be in a folder).
In the supplied script, folder 'dictionaries' contains the desired
dictionaries, both '.aff' and '.dic' parts.

Then run the script as ./build.sh from its own directory.

A folder 'distzeugs' will be produced, which is then tar.gzipped up for
distribution into 'zeugs-linux-<version>.tar.gz'.

The 'zeugs.sh' script should be used for starting the program (it sets
the proper library path).
